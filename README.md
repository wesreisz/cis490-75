Android Development Course Material

The Fall 2014 Computer Information System Special Topics course introduces mobile 
application development challenges today, and then dives deeply into application 
development with Android.

Students shall gain a:
- realistic overview of the landscape of mobility today
- fundamental understanding of how mobile applications are designed (focused on Android)
- practical hands on skill writing Android applications
- deeper understanding of the process of software development

My goal is to introduce you writing mobile apps. You will learn by doing, so there is 
a heavy expectation of homework.
